          A Letter Just for You 💌

          My dearest Akansha,<br /><br />
          I don’t know where to begin, but I know where my heart always ends up — with you. 🥺  
          From the very first time I liked your tweet in May 2024, to the nights we stayed up talking,  
          something in you kept pulling me closer. Maybe it was your laugh. Maybe your eyes. Maybe your chaos. Or maybe just... you.  
          <br /><br />

          You say you’re moody — I say you’re real.  
          You say you overthink — I say you feel deeply.  
          You say you're too much — but baby, you're just enough for me. 💖  
          <br /><br />

          I know the doctor journey isn’t easy. The late nights, the pressure, the constant questioning of “Am I enough?” — but I promise you, you are.  
          One day, some scared patient is going to hold your hand and feel safe. Just like I do.  
          <br /><br />

          You carry the heart of a child — the one who loved Rapunzel, giggled with Olaf, and believed in magic. That magic never left you.  
          I see it every time you doodle, rant, dance, or just randomly say “heyyy.”  
          That’s the girl I fell for — and the woman I’m still falling for, every single day. 💞  
          <br /><br />

          Through all the kalesh, mood swings, random vanishing, and even that scary rage mode of yours —  
          I still look at you and think:  
          _"I want her."_  
          Not the perfect version.  
          Not the filtered version.  
          Just **you.**  
          <br /><br />

          You are my calm and my chaos.  
          My best fight and my favorite peace.  
          My reason to write, and my home to return to.  
          <br /><br />

          I don’t promise a perfect love story — but I promise effort, presence, patience, and the kind of love that stays.  
          Always yours,<br />
          — The guy who still melts at your “Ayu”
